# Learning-Diary
A daily record of what I have learnt on that day

**20th October 2022**

Having had a cohort 12 Founders & Coders alumni (Fatimat) come in and tell us about her experience was extremely insightful and a few things i took away from it were: 

- Try and break things down and learn one thing at a time, otherwise you'll get overwhelmed trying to learn a lot in a short space of time.
- Don't try and memorise everything you learn, as long as you understand the principle of what you're learning. You can always good the code side of things later.
- If you're not struggling you're not challenging yourself enough. Keep challenging yourself, it's the best way to learn.
